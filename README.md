# Flow Technique Database

This is a database for flow techniques (tricks, moves) and sequences which are a chain of techniques. You can add a description, video demonstration, and video comment to each technique for the opportunity to spread your knowledge to other flow artists. 

I originally started this as a project for my Software Engineering boot camp with General Assembly.

In planning for this project, I completed the User authentication first, followed by the techniques, and finally the sequences. I was able to increase the usability (drop down buttons, modals, delete and update buttons in technique index) of the site after I had completed the structure. My public launch date is currently 1/01/2022.

## Setup Steps
  1. Fork and clone this repository
  2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
  3. Use `grunt serve` to start up server.
